 * <p>Deletes a tracker resource from your Amazon Web Services account.</p>

 *                 applications.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LocationClient, DeleteTrackerCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-location"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LocationClient, DeleteTrackerCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-location"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LocationClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteTrackerRequest
 *   TrackerName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteTrackerCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteTrackerCommandInput - {@link DeleteTrackerCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteTrackerCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteTrackerCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteTrackerCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LocationClientResolvedConfig | config} for LocationClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because of insufficient access or permissions. Check with an
 *       administrator to verify your permissions.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The request has failed to process because of an unknown server error, exception, or failure.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The resource that you've entered was not found in your AWS account.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ThrottlingException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was denied because of request throttling.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ValidationException} (client fault)
