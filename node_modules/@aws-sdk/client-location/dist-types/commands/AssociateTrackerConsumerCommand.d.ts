 * <p>Creates an association between a geofence collection and a tracker resource. This

 *             collection. </p>
 *          <p>You can associate up to five geofence collections to each tracker resource.</p>
 *          <note>

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LocationClient, AssociateTrackerConsumerCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-location"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LocationClient, AssociateTrackerConsumerCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-location"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LocationClient(config);
 * const input = { // AssociateTrackerConsumerRequest

 * const command = new AssociateTrackerConsumerCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
